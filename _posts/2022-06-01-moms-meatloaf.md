My mom's meatloaf is the best meatloaf I've ever had. It's so moist and flavorful, and it always comes out perfect. My mom has been making this recipe for as long as I can remember, and it's always a hit, especially when we were growing up poor. It was one of the few things that she could make that everyone in our family liked. 

I remember one particular time when we were really struggling financially. My mom had to get creative with our meals and she came up with this dish that she called "poor man's meatloaf." It was basically just ground beef, breadcrumbs, and some spices. But it tasted so good that we didn't even care that we were eating "poor man's food."

This dish is so special to me because it reminds me of my childhood and how my mom always managed to make do with what little she had.

The key to my mom's success is her secret ingredient: ketchup. Yep, that's right - ketchup. My mom swears by it, and she always puts a good amount in her meatloaf. The ketchup adds a sweetness and depth of flavor that really makes the dish shine. Trust me, this is one secret ingredient that you don't want to leave out!

In addition to the ketchup, my mom also uses a lot of onions in her meatloaf. She says that the onions help to keep the meatloaf moist and add a ton of flavor. I definitely agree with her on both counts! The onions really do make a difference, so don't skip them if you can help it.

Last but not least, my mom always tops her meatloaf with a thick layer of bacon before baking it. This might seem like an odd step, but trust me - it works! The bacon adds another layer of flavor and helps to keep the meatloaf moist during cooking. Plus, who doesn't love bacon? It's just another reason why my mom's meatloaf is the best!
