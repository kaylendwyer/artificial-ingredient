The leaves are starting to change color and the air is getting cooler. Fall is definitely in the air! I love this time of year, when the days are shorter and the nights are longer. It's a time for cozy fires and hot drinks. And of course, fall food!

I always get excited about seasonal produce when fall rolls around. There's nothing better than fresh apples or pumpkins straight from the farm. I love incorporating them into recipes both sweet and savory. This year, I'm planning on making a lot of pies, roasted vegetables, hearty soups, and, of course, apple cider donuts.

What are your favorite things about fall? What recipes do you like to make this time of year?

The first time I had an apple cider donut was at my local cider mill. I was with my family and we were getting our annual fall supply of apples. We always get a few extra bags to make pies and other treats with, and of course, we always get a gallon or two of fresh apple cider. As we were leaving, my mom saw the sign for apple cider donuts and said we should try them.

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but these donuts were delicious! They were soft and fluffy on the inside with a slight crunch from the sugar coating on the outside. The flavor of the cider came through perfectly without being too overwhelming. And they weren't too sweet either, which was nice.

Every year, as the leaves begin to change color and the weather starts to cool, I make a batch of apple cider donuts. It's become something of a tradition for me, and I always look forward to it.

There's something about the combination of sweet apple cider and rich, flavorful donuts that just feels like fall. And even though I always use the same recipe, each batch turns out slightly different depending on the apples I use.

So if you're looking for a delicious treat to enjoy this autumn season, why not give my apple cider donuts a try? You won't be disappointed!

These apple cider donuts are soft and fluffy on the inside with a crispy outer coating. They are slightly sweet with a hint of tartness from the apples, and they have a wonderful warm spice flavor from the cinnamon and nutmeg.

## Ingredients
* 1 cup apple cider
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/4 cup sugar, plus 1/2 cup for coating the donuts
* vegetable shortening or oil, for frying

## Directions: 
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the apple cider, vegetable oil, eggs and salt. In another bowl, whisk together the baking soda, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until well combined.

2. Heat 2 to 3 inches of vegetable shortening or oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until it reaches 350 degrees F on a candy thermometer.

3. Working in batches of 5 or 6 donuts at a time, carefully add them to the hot oil and fry for about 1 minute per side, until they are golden brown all over. Drain on paper towels.

4. While still warm (but not too hot), toss the donuts in a bag with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar to coat completely. Serve warm or at room temperature
