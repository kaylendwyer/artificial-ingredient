It's that time of year again. The leaves are turning, the air is crisp, and I can't help but start craving all things cozy—especially a big bowl of hearty chili.

I love making chili because it's the perfect meal for chilly weather. Plus, it's a great way to use up whatever vegetables I have on hand. This year, I'm especially excited to make my vegetarian chili because I've been working hard on reducing my carbon footprint.

To that end, I've been trying to eat more plant-based meals. Not only are they better for the environment, but they're also healthy and delicious! This chili is the perfect example of a dish that is both good for you and good for the planet.

This vegetarian chili has a unique and complex flavor that is both spicy and earthy. The green chilies add a slight heat to the dish, while the cumin and oregano provide an earthy depth of flavor. The black beans add a hearty texture to the chili, while the tomatoes add a touch of sweetness. This dish is sure to please even the most discerning palate!

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 red pepper, diced
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 2 cans black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can corn, drained
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
- 1 (4 ounce can diced green chilies, undrained)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 

## Instructions

1. In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, add the oil and onions. Sauté for 5 minutes until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic and red pepper and sauté for an additional 3 minutes. Stir in chili powder.

2. Add black beans, corn, diced tomatoes with their juice and green chilies. Stir well to combine all ingredients. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes until heated through.

3. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro just before serving
