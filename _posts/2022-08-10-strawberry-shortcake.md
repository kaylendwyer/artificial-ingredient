The strawberry fields are a beautiful sight. Rows and rows of strawberries, all different sizes and colors, extend as far as the eye can see. The air is filled with the sweet smell of strawberries, and the sun is shining down on the ripe fruit.

It's amazing to see how many strawberries are out there, and it's even more amazing to think about how each one was grown. Every strawberry in those fields has its own unique story, from the moment it was planted to the day it was picked.

The strawberry fields are a reminder of the hard work that goes into growing food. The farmers who tend these fields work long hours in all kinds of weather to make sure their crops are healthy and productive. They deserve our respect and gratitude for their efforts.

This strawberry shortcake is the perfect summer dessert! The fluffy cake, fresh strawberries, and creamy whipped cream come together to create a delicious treat that will have you coming back for more.

The cake is light and airy, with a hint of sweetness from the strawberries. The fresh berries are juicy and add a lovely tartness to the dish. And the whipped cream is rich and creamy, providing a perfect balance to the other flavors.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb. strawberries, quartered
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 recipe shortcake biscuits (see below)

- Shortcake Biscuits: 
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced
- 2/3 cup buttermilk, plus more for brushing

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a medium bowl, combine strawberries, sugar, and cornstarch; set aside.

3. To make the biscuits, in a large bowl whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add cold butter and use your fingers to work it into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 2/3 cup of buttermilk until dough comes together.

4. Place dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to 1-inch thickness. Cut out biscuits using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter and place on prepared baking sheet; brush tops with additional buttermilk. Bake in preheated oven for 12 minutes or until golden brown."

5. To assemble strawberry shortcakes, split warm biscuits in half, then top bottom halves with whipped cream and fresh strawberries.
