I love growing thyme in my container garden! It's such a versatile herb that can be used in so many different dishes. Plus, it's really easy to grow and doesn't require a lot of maintenance.

The delicate little leaves are so fragrant and add such a wonderful flavor to dishes. I especially love using thyme in chicken recipes. The other day, I was craving lemon thyme chicken and decided to make it for dinner.

I started growing thyme a few years ago, and it has quickly become one of my favorite herbs to grow. I usually start seeds indoors in late winter or early spring, and then transplant the seedlings into my outdoor garden beds once the weather warms up.

Thyme is a hardy plant that can handle a little bit of neglect, so it's perfect for busy gardeners like me. I just make sure to water it regularly and give it some occasional fertilizer, and it always does well.

If you're thinking about growing thyme in your own garden, I highly recommend it! It's a great herb to have on hand, and it's really easy to grow.

I used some of my fresh thyme to make a creamy lemon thyme chicken last night, and it was absolutely delicious. This dish is so fragrant and flavorful, you'll be hooked at first bite! Creamy lemon thyme chicken is a simple yet elegant weeknight meal. Tender chicken breasts are simmered in a creamy sauce flavored with fresh lemon juice and thyme. Serve over a bed of rice or pasta for an easy and satisfying meal.

If you're looking for a new recipe to try, I highly recommend this one. It's easy to make, and it's sure to please even the pickiest eaters.

## Ingredients
- 1 pound chicken breast, cubed
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1 lemon, juiced and zested
- 1 teaspoon thyme leaves
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/3 cup heavy cream

## Instructions
 1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
 2. Place chicken in a shallow bowl. Sprinkle with flour, using your hands to coat evenly.
 3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat olive oil. Add chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.
 4. Add onion and garlic to the pan and cook until softened, about 3 minutes more.
 5. Pour in wine and lemon juice and bring to a simmer. Stir in thyme leaves and season with salt and pepper as needed.
 6. Transfer contents of the pan to an oven-safe dish and bake for 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through completely.
 7. Finish by stirring in heavy cream just before serving hot over rice or pasta
