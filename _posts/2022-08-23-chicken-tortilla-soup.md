As I walk out to my backyard, I am enveloped in the smell of limes. My lime trees are overloaded with fruit this year, and the sweet-tart aroma is intoxicating. The branches are weighed down with hundreds of limes, and many of them are going to waste because I can't possibly use them all myself.

Last night, the smell of the limes made me crave a chicken tortilla soup. I hadn't had it in years, but I knew I could make a delicious soup with all of the fresh ingredients that I had on hand.

The soup was everything that I hoped for and more. The lime juice added a bright acidity to the rich broth, and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The tortillas provided a satisfying crunch, and the cilantro brought it all together with its earthy flavor. It was a perfect meal for a cool evening, and I'm already looking forward to having it again soon.
