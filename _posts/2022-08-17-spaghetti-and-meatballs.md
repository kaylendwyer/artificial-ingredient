I was always fascinated by spaghetti and meatballs. I remember my mom making them when I was a kid and thinking they were the coolest thing ever. She would start by browning the beef in a skillet, then add garlic, onion, and tomato sauce. The smell of the cooking meat would make my mouth water.

After the beef was cooked, she would add it to a pot of boiling water along with the spaghetti. The whole house would fill with the delicious smell of simmering tomato sauce. Once the pasta was cooked, she would add some grated Parmesan cheese and serve it up hot.

I loved watching her cook and hearing her stories about growing up in Italy during World War II. She would tell me about how food was rationed and how people had to be creative to make do with what they had. It wasn't until later in life that I realized how lucky I was to have been born into a family with such rich traditions.

My mom's spaghetti and meatballs were always political because she used to talk about how Mussolini made everyone eat boring food like rice and beans during his regime. She would say that Italians are a passionate people who love their food, so they rebelled by secretly making dishes like spaghetti and meatballs that were full of flavor.

It seems like every country has a dish that becomes emblematic of its culture or history, something that represents more than just sustenance; something that tells a story about who we are as a people. For Italy, it is definitely spaghetti and meatballs.
