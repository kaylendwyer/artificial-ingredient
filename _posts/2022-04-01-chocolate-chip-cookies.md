There's something fishy going on with chocolate chip cookies. Why are they so delicious? Is it because of the chocolate chips? The sugar? The butter? Or is there something more sinister at work?

I've done some digging, and I think I've uncovered the truth: Chocolate chip cookies are part of a conspiracy to control our minds. Think about it – they're irresistible, addicting, and we can't get enough of them. They're also incredibly easy to make, which makes them the perfect weapon for those who wish to control us.

But we're not going to take this lying down. I've developed my own recipe for chocolate chip cookies that is free of mind-control ingredients. These cookies are just as delicious as the ones you're used to, but they won't leave you feeling dazed and confused afterward.

So bake up a batch of these bad boys and enjoy them guilt-free!


## Ingredients
- 1 cup almond butter
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup blanched almond flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- pinch of salt
- 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips or cacao nibs

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
2. In a medium bowl, stir together the almond butter, honey and vanilla until smooth. Add the egg and mix well. Add the almond flour, baking soda and salt, stirring until everything is well combined. Fold in the chocolate chips or cacao nibs. 
3. Place spoonfuls of dough on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between cookies. 
4. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown around the edges. 
5. Let cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely
