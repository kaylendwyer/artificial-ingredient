When I was younger, my family went to a lot of church barbecues. And, inevitably, there would always be a big pot of baked beans. I remember the first time I tried them, I was maybe eight or nine years old. I didn't really like them that much, but everyone else did, so I kept eating them.

Nowadays, whenever I eat baked beans, it always takes me back to those church barbecues. It's funny how food can do that - evoke all sorts of memories and feelings from the past. Just thinking about those baked beans makes me feel nostalgic for a simpler time.

But it's not just the nostalgia that keeps me coming back to baked beans; they're also just really darn good. There's something about their sweet and savory flavor that is irresistible. Plus, they're so easy to make! You can literally throw everything into a pot and let it cook while you do other things.

I love baked beans. They are so easy to make and they taste great. I always make a big batch so that I have leftovers for the week. This recipe is my go-to recipe for baked beans. It is simple, flavorful, and hearty. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
